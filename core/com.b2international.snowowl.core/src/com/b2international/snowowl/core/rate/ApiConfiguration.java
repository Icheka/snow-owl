	/**
	 * The default value of this configuration is the desired Cache-Control header value to set when responding to any GET requests that is targeting
	 * a resource's content branch. Since objects in our system are stored in a revision-controlled way (along with authorization information) we are
	 * unable to let downstream HTTP caches to cache our content without enforcing revalidation of it immediately (to prevent data leakage). Thus the
	 * default value of this Cache-Control allows well crafted HTTP proxies to store the response in their cache, but immediately set it to stale
	 * (max-age=0) and enforce revalidation of that stale content (must-revalidate). This ensures that we use downstream caches as much as possible by
	 * preventing data leakage and stale responses.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <h3>Revalidation</h3> When a browser or proxy HTTP cache would try to use the cached response with this header they must first send a request
	 * to the server to check whether the cached response can be used or not. All the content served by Snow Owl will have an ETag header set so that
	 * during revalidation the client can send the ETag value in the If-None-Match header for verification. If the ETag value is still valid the cache
	 * response can be used (HTTP 304 Not Modified will be sent back as response), if not the server will generate a new response and send it back to
	 * update the cached value.
